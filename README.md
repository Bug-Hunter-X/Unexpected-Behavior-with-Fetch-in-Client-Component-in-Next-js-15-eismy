## Unexpected Behavior with Fetch in Client Component in Next.js 15
This example demonstrates a potential issue when using `fetch` in a client component within a Next.js 15 application to interact with an API route.  The problem stems from the way Next.js 15 handles requests differently depending on whether they're made on the client-side or server-side.

The `pages/about.js` component fetches data from the API route `/api/hello`.  While this approach works in many cases, it can lead to problems, especially related to data fetching, timing, and error handling during initial page load or client-side navigation.  The solution shows a more robust approach to data fetching that accounts for these complexities.

### Potential Issues:

* **Unexpected Loading States:** The loading state might not display correctly, leading to a brief flicker or unexpected behavior.  The initial fetch might complete after the component has already rendered, causing inconsistent UI updates.
* **Error Handling:** The current error handling is simplistic. More sophisticated error handling is needed to gracefully manage potential network issues or API errors.
* **Data Race Conditions:**  Concurrent fetches might lead to race conditions if not handled properly.  The solution addresses this using appropriate state management techniques.

### Solution:

The solution illustrates a improved data fetching strategy in the `bugSolution.js` file to address the limitations of the initial approach.  The solution demonstrates a more robust way to fetch data from the API route, accounting for loading states and errors.
